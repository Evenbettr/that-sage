        A grounded, herbal clean. Calming lavender meets crisp sage for a scrub that resets your whole vibe —
        smoothing rough spots, softening skin, and leaving a quiet, steady scent behind.

    <!-- Intro Philosophy -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <p>
          There’s a lot out there. Some of it’s wonderful. Some of it… less so.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started that sage because we believe healthy living begins
          with familiar ingredients that you can easily read and understand.
         </p>
             

    <!-- What We Make -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h3>Everyday essentials, kept simple.</h3>
        <p>
          We focus on small collections of personal-care — lip balms,
          scrubs, soaps, and body scents — handmade in small batches.        </p>
        <p>
          Each formula is designed to do what it’s meant to do, without
          unnecessary additives, synthetic dyes, or harsh preservatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we wouldn’t use it ourselves, we don’t put it in our products.
        </p>
      </div>

    <!-- Ingredients Philosophy -->

      <div class="container">
        <h3>What’s inside matters.</h3>
        <p>
          Many people are only now discovering how ingredient lists
          have become unusually large— and how often they include things that don’t belong on your skin or your 
          body at all.
          
          With our pproducts you’ll never find parabens, artificial dyes, or filler ingredients
          chosen purely for shelf appeal. Instead, we use oils, butters,
          botanicals, and waxes with a long, well-understood history of use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clear names. Clear purpose. Clear conscience.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Guidance Section -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h3>A quieter way to choose.</h3>
        <p>
          We don’t believe in fear-based wellness or shouting about what’s “bad.”
        </p>
        <p>
          that sage is here to help you make everyday choices with a little
          more clarity — offering products you can trust, and information that
          feels grounded instead of overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to be a calm voice in a noisy room.

    <!-- Small Batch -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h3>Made with care, not urgency.</h3>
        <p>
          Our products are made in small batches so we can pay attention to every detail, from the  
          quality, to sourcing, and to the people who use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn’t about scale or speed. It’s about getting it right, every time.

        <h3>About that sage</h3>
        <p>
          that sage was created for people who want to take better care of
          themselves without turning it into a full-time job.
        </p>
       
        <p>
          We believe care should feel nurturing — not complicated. That labels
          should be readable. That ingredients should be familiar.
