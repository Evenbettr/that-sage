    <!-- Intro Philosophy -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <p>
          There’s a lot out there. Some of it’s wonderful. Some of it… less so.
        </p>
        <p>
          that sage exists to make everyday care feel calm again — with clean,
          familiar ingredients and formulations you don’t need a chemistry
          degree to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          No panic. No purity contests. Just thoughtful choices, made quietly.

    <!-- What We Make -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h3>Everyday essentials, kept simple.</h3>
        <p>
          We focus on a small collection of personal-care staples — lip balms,
          scrubs, soaps, and body scents — made with purpose and restraint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each formula is designed to do what it’s meant to do, without
          unnecessary additives, synthetic dyes, or harsh preservatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it doesn’t belong, it doesn’t go in.

    <!-- Ingredients Philosophy -->

      <div class="container">
        <h3>What’s inside matters.</h3>
        <p>
          Many people are only now discovering how crowded ingredient lists
          have become — and how often they include things that don’t serve the
          body at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          We take a simpler approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ll never find parabens, artificial dyes, or filler ingredients
          chosen purely for shelf appeal. Instead, we use oils, butters,
          botanicals, and waxes with a long, well-understood history of use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clear names. Clear purpose. Clear conscience.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>A quieter way to choose.</h3>
        <p>
          We don’t believe in fear-based wellness or shouting about what’s “bad.”
        </p>
        <p>
          that sage is here to help you navigate everyday choices with a little
          more clarity — offering products you can trust, and information that
          feels grounded instead of overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of us as a calm voice in a noisy room.

          quality, to sourcing, and to the people who use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn’t about scale or speed. It’s about getting it right, every time.

        <h3>About that sage</h3>
        <p>
          that sage was created for people who want to take better care of
          themselves without turning it into a full-time job.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who love soft light, warm tea, open windows, and products
          that feel comforting rather than corrective.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe care should feel nurturing — not complicated. That labels
          should be readable. That ingredients should be familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
          that sage is here to guide, not alarm. To simplify, not overwhelm.
          To offer a steadier path forward.
